# A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to Modeling Rat Behavior in Peak Interval Procedure
## Observation space:
The agent can observe its position.

Making the agent have a diameter of 1 unit, the positions are
`[[0,5.26],[0, 4.2]]`


A second is equivalent to 5 tickes and the agent's speed is
0.175 units per tick and can only move within bounds in he
four cardinal directions
